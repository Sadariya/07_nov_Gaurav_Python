What are negative indexes and why are they used ?

--> Negative index is used to access string from 
    last to starting at string.

--> Negative indexing is used to in python to begin
    slicing from the end of the string.

--> It is used because in such condition we need to
    access string from the last of the string so 
    negative index helps to save our time.
